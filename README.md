# Drug_review_condition_classification

This project is focused on classifying drug reviews according to the conditions they are treating. Specifically, the project uses machine learning techniques to automatically categorize drug reviews based on the medical conditions that they mention.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file, which can be installed using the following command:

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project by running the app.py script. This script will preprocess the data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate the model's performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Drug Review Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains drug reviews and ratings for various medical conditions.

Methodology
This project uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify drug reviews according to the medical conditions that they mention. Specifically, the project uses a bag-of-words representation of the text data and trains a model to make predictions.

Results
The project achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Further details about the performance of the model can be found in the results.ipynb notebook.

Future Work
There are several ways in which this project could be extended or improved:

Consider using more advanced NLP techniques, such as word embeddings or neural networks.
Explore different machine learning models, such as decision trees or support vector machines.
Investigate the use of additional features, such as the age or gender of the patient.
Collect more data to improve the performance of the model.
